# Potato Disease Classification using CNN & GCP API

## Overview
This project is a deep learning-based classification system for detecting potato diseases using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The model categorizes potato leaves into three classes:

- **Early Blight**
- **Late Blight**
- **Healthy**

The trained model is deployed as an **API on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** and is integrated with a **Flutter** mobile application, allowing users to upload images of potato leaves for real-time classification.

## Tech Stack
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **API Backend**: Flask/FastAPI
- **Cloud Deployment**: Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run / Cloud Functions)
- **Mobile App**: Flutter
- **Dataset**: PlantVillage (Publicly Available)

## Project Structure
```bash
ðŸ“‚ potato-disease-classification
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ backend-api          # Flask/FastAPI API for model inference
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ model-training       # CNN training script and model development
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ flutter-app          # Flutter mobile application
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ dataset              # PlantVillage dataset (if included)
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ README.md            # This README file
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ requirements.txt      # Dependencies for API
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“œ model.h5             # Trained CNN model
```

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Running the API Locally
```bash
# Navigate to backend-api folder
cd backend-api

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the API
python app.py
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### 2. Deploying the API on GCP
```bash
# Authenticate with GCP
gcloud auth login

# Deploy API (Cloud Run example)
gcloud run deploy potato-disease-api --source .
```
The API will be available at a public URL generated by GCP.

### 3. Running the Flutter App
```bash
# Navigate to Flutter app directory
cd flutter-app

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run
```

## API Usage
Once the API is running, you can test it using **Postman** or **cURL**.

### Sample Request (cURL)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict" \
     -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
     -F "file=@path_to_your_image.jpg"
```

### Sample Response
```json
{
  "class": "Late Blight",
  "confidence": 0.92
}
```
